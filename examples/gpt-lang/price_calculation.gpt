Price calculation
R1 The customer gets 10% price reduction if the price of the goods reaches 200 euros.
R2 The delivery is free if the weight of the goods is under 5 kilograms. 
   Reaching 5 kg, the delivery price is the weight in euros, thus, when the products together are 6 kilograms then the delivery price is 6 euros. 
   However, the delivery remains free if the price of the goods exceeds 100 euros.
R3 If the customer prepays with a credit card, then s/he gets 3% price reduction from the (possibly reduced) price of the goods.
R4 The output is the price to be paid. The minimum price difference is 0.1 euro, the minimum weight difference is 0.1 kg.
